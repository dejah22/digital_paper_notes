# Cutesy Digital Paper-pad with Animated Writing and Scratch Sounds

An interactive digital notepad built with **React**.
Type whatever you want on your keyboard, and the text appears as _animated handwriting_ on lined paper - complete with scratch scounds to simulate the experience of writing on a real notebook.

## Features
- **Handwritten Animation** – Typed text is drawn stroke by stroke like real handwriting.  
- **Scratch Sounds** – Each letter plays a pencil sound for an authentic vibe.
